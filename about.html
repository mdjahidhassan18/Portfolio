       Hello! I'm <b>Md Jahid Hasan</b>, a 25-year-old student pursuing <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at <b>Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET)</b>.
       Although my academic journey currently unfolds in Chittagong, my roots lie in the vibrant city of Rajshahi, where I completed my schooling at 
       Seriol Govt High School and pursued higher secondary at Rajshahi Govt City College. My fascination with technology and design led me to the areas
        of embedded system design, mechanical 3D design, and project development. I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into tangible creations. 
        Working collaboratively is something I truly enjoyâ€”I believe in the power of teamwork to achieve remarkable outcomes. In addition to my academic pursuits, 
        I have honed my skills in various tools, including Microsoft Word and PowerPoint for effective communication, EasyEDA for electronic circuit design, and 
        SolidWorks for intricate 3D modeling. I consider myself a lifelong learner, always eager to explore new horizons and acquire exciting knowledge. The 
        dynamic field of Mechanical Engineering provides me with the perfect canvas to indulge my curiosity and passion for innovation. As I navigate through 
        my academic and professional journey, I look forward to applying my skills and contributing to meaningful projects that make a difference.
